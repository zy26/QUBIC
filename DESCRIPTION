Description: The core function of this R package is to provide the
    implementation of the well-cited and well-reviewed QUBIC algorithm, aiming to
    deliver an effective and efficient biclustering capability. This package also
    includes the following related functions: (i) a qualitative representation
    of the input gene expression data, through a well-designed discretization way
    considering the underlying data property, which can be directly used in other
    biclustering programs; (ii) visualization of identified biclusters using heatmap
    in support of overall expression pattern analysis; (iii) bicluster-based
    co-expression network elucidation and visualization, where different correlation
    coefficient scores between a pair of genes are provided; and (iv) a generalize
    output format of biclusters and corresponding network can be freely downloaded
    so that a user can easily do following comprehensive functional enrichment
    analysis (e.g. DAVID) and advanced network visualization (e.g. cytoscape).
